# Django Rest Framework Project

The objective of this project is learn how to use Django Rest Framework effectivly to build a project
idea that would use this frame work as a backend to a React.js frontend.

The book I read was written by Gaston C. Hillar and published in June 2018.
This book uses Django version 1.11, which I updated to django == "*", as I use Pipenv for an enviroment.
I go for the lastest version of Django at this moment django version 3.

This project has no frontend to speak of, its more about the backend/api's than anything else.

## What was learned

Serializers and deserializers = Creating serializers.py files from the models that where created for the project.

Creating of views using function based views and then class based views.

Providing correct urls form the views.

The use of Postman to test the api's are functioning as expected.

Working with advanced relationships between different models and serializations.
